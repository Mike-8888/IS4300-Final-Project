Gun VS Cream.Rmd is the main file to analyze the data set to verify the hypothesis of "More gun, less cream"

Gun-VS-Cream.docx is the report that is generated by the markdown file

Guns.csv is the original data set

Gun.csv is the modified data set (in the law variable, the data changes from "yes" to 1, and "no" to 0)

Supplement.R is the R script that used to develop the markdown file
